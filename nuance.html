				<h1>SUMMER @ NUANCE</h1>
				<h2>My summer internship in voice user interface design.</h2>
					<img src="images/nuance/nuance.png" alt="" class="portphotoshead" style="width:35%;"/>

					<p><em>I spent my summer 2017 with Nuance Communications in New York City, where I designed interactive voice response (IVR) systems for several enterprise clients. I worked alongside UI designers, developers, speech scientists, and project managers on our team, and met several times a week virtually with client contacts. I presented my designs on-site with clients four times throughout the course of the summer.</em><br/><br/>

					<b>My Role:</b> Voice UI Design Intern<br/><br/>
					<b>Timeline:</b> May – August 2017<br/><br/>
					<b>Process:</b></p>

				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>I had the opportunity to take part in designing voice applications for several clients over the course of the summer. Most of the projects I joined were in the later stages of the design process; however, I did get to take part in designing one application from start to near finish during the course of the internship, which I’ll outline in more detail below.</p>

				<h2>Phase I: Sample Calls</h2>
				<p>The first stage of the design process was writing sample calls that demonstrate the system’s persona, tone, and style. I wrote 3 sample calls alongside another UI designer. We met frequently to ensure that our verbiage was consistent and that our prompt wording was clear and natural.<br/><br/>

				We presented these sample calls to our client to ensure we were on the same page as the client in terms of business requirements. In our meetings, we highlighted client or domain-specific terms to use and/or avoid. We were also able to discuss whether the persona we had developed matched the vision they had in mind for the system based on their marketing research.<br/><br/>

				Below is a sample call (identifying client name and terminology redacted) that I wrote for a billing self-service module. On the sidebar are notes I took down during our client meeting for additional iteration before moving on to designing call flows.</p>

				<h2>Phase II: Call Flows</h2>
				<p>Once the client approved our sample calls, we moved on to the next phase of the design process: call flows.</p>
				<h3>Skeletal Call Flows</h3>
				<p>Using our sample calls, we created flow charts visualizing the system logic associated with all possible user flows through the system. In addition to system prompts and potential caller utterances, database requests needed to retrieve front and back-end variables for the prompts are visualized.<br/><br/>

				Again, these specifications were valuable when presenting our designs to our client. I created 3 call flows for the modules I had written sample calls for. The call flow below is an extension of the sample call above. I walked our client through my call flows over several iterations, and finally presented these deliverables on-site with the client at the end of the summer.</p>

				<h3>Detailed Call Flows</h3>
				<p>After agreeing upon the system logic and flow, I fleshed out the details of the call flow by defining the variables needed from the client API to ensure the call flow operated as we designed. I met several times a week with the client’s API developers to ensure they had the data we’d need.</p>

				<h2>Phase III: Usability Testing</h2>
				<p>The final stage of the design process that I was able to participate in that summer was in usability testing. While the project outlined above was not ready for testing by the end of the summer, I was able to take part in a usability test for another application developed by our team. <br/><br/>

				I created logging sheets for our team and client - who came to the usability lab for the two days of testing- to use for note-taking while observing the 12 usability tests. I aggregated the notes from the 3 designers, 2 developers, PM, and clients to facilitate our team’s writing of the usability report.</p>

				<h2>Phase IV: Reflection</h2>
				<p>My summer internship at Nuance broadened my understanding of interaction design and immersed me in the world of voice user interface design. Over the course of the summer, I was able to develop my design, programming, and research skills. Throughout the design process, we utilized methods similar to those I have learned in courses at UMSI. I learned, however, that designing for voice very often required me to turn these methods on their heads, as users have different goals and are in different contexts when interacting with IVRs than they are when using screen based applications.<br/><br/>

				I am very interested in pursuing VUI design further as voice technologies become more and more pervasive in users’ lives. There are a lot of articles out there about how VUI design is the next big thing, but the truth is that it’s been out there for a while, and users have developed complicated relationships with voice-driven systems. It is a very exciting time to be involved in VUI design- there is a lot of work to be done, and a lot of unknowns, but it is so, so fascinating.</p>
